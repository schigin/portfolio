Selecting clients from a specific region is possible by clicking on this region in the Map section (take a look at the screenshot above). When the chosen area is unclicked, the dashboard returns to its original configuration. The corresponding controllers can be used to change age and balance groups sizes. The Insights tab summarizes and displays regional differences as a Story.
